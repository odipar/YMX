/**
 * What a plain YM2149 actually sees.
 *
 * <p>A YM6 file carries its special effects (SID voice, digidrum, sinus-SID,
 * sync-buzzer) in bits that the sound chip itself does not use: the top nibbles
 * of R1/R3, the top bits of R6/R7 and of the three volume registers, plus R14
 * and R15 as effect data. YMX plays no effects, so those bits are
 * masked away here - once, at packing time. That is both correct (they are not
 * chip state) and cheaper: constant high bits compress better, and the player
 * needs no masking code at all.
 *
 * <p>The one register that is not a plain mask is R13, the envelope shape.
 * A YM frame stores {@code $FF} there to mean "leave the shape alone"; writing
 * any value to R13 restarts the envelope, so that marker has to survive packing
 * and be honoured by the player.
 *
 * <p>R7's two top bits are the chip's I/O port directions, not sound. They are
 * masked off here and the player supplies the ST's own value, because on an ST
 * port A drives the floppy select lines.
