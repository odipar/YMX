/**
 * The progress report the optimal parsers print: an exact percentage of the
 * parse's inner-loop steps, and a time estimate fitted to how the parse has
 * been slowing down.
 *
 * <p>The step count is exact and owes nothing to the data - position {@code
 * index} is tried against every offset from 1 to {@code clamp(index, 1,
 * offsetLimit)}, so the total is a closed form known before the first step.
 * What a step <em>costs</em> is another matter - one that finds a match does
 * more work than one that finds nothing - so the percentage measures progress,
 * not remaining time. The estimate handles time: elapsed is fitted as {@code
 * a*x + b*x^2} in the percentage, through the warm-up point, the midpoint and
 * now. The square makes it work on real assets: a parse that finds
 * more matches as it goes gets steadily slower, and a rate measured over any
 * window - however recent - keeps predicting the past.
